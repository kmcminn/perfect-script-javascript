## perfect-script-javascript
I was tempted to use several modules like [yargs](https://github.com/chevex/yargs) and [minimist](https://github.com/substack/minimist) and [sync](https://github.com/mgutz/execSync) versions of things like exec, but then it wouldn't be perfect. :)

#### thoughts
1. it doesn't require any modules so there's that
2. callbacks weren't designed with scripting in mind
3. wtb argument parsing would be nice in the stdlib
4. module.parent doesn't feel very robust
5. console.log should be aliased to print()#

#### feedback
open an issue if you have any feedback or ideas to improve this.
