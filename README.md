## perfect-script-javascript
I was tempated to use several modules like yargs, or minimist or sync versions of built-ins, but then the script wouldn't be perfect

### reasons
1. it doesn't require any modules
2. callbacks weren't designed with scripting in mind
3. this language needs some lovin before it'll be able to compete with the usefulness of ruby, python and bash
